If you try to do the same experiment of this paper, you should follow the following steps:

**STEP 1ï¼š** Prepare data ( dataset and testdata )

**STEP 2:** Generate **coreclass** of each commit

**STEP 3:** Generate **coupling relationship** of each commit

**STEP 4:** Generate **corpus** of each commit

**STEP 5:** On the testdata, use JRipples, Rose, Impactminer to generate the original result

**STEP 6:** Run Impactanalysis code to boost the result.

# STEP 2
See `./coreclass_generation_project` for details

<br/>
# STEP 3
See `./CouplingRel_generation_project` for details

<br/>
# STEP 4
See `./Corpus_generation_project` for details

<br/>
# STEP 5
The output of these tools should organize as follow:

This file include orginal sorted(according to their probability of being impacted) predicted impacted classes.
